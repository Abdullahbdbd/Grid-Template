          incredibly fun! I wnrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my
          life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR

        </h2>
        <p class="second-fontsp">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy and make a good living while doing something I love. Thank you for the wonderful experience! Thank you for the wonderful experience!
